**It seems on macOS 10.15.6, Unshaky no longer works unless by default, workaround: [issue #166](https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/issues/166)**

**Unshaky** tries to address an issue on the butterfly keyboard (Macbook, Macbook Air 2018 & MacBook Pro 2016 and later): Double Key Press (See "[User complaints](#complaints-about-this-issue)" below). 

Apple made it difficult to replace only the keyboard and it costs hundreds of dollars. **Unshaky** might save your keyboard by dismissing such "second key hits" (any key presses that occur no later than x milliseconds after the previous effective one). I fixed my "w" key with **Unshaky**, and if it does not work for you, open an issue [here](https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/issues). The image below illustrates how Unshaky works.

[June 2018] Good news, Apple launched a [Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/), and go get your keyboard fixed, maybe temporarily.

[May 2019] Apple extends [the service program](https://www.apple.com/ca/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/) to cover all MacBook (Air & Pro) with 3rd gen butterfly keyboards.

[May 2020] [The Verge: The saga of Apple’s bad butterfly MacBook keyboards is finally over](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design).

## How-To

[Download Unshaky.app here](https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/releases)

First, move the "Unshaky.app" to your "/Applications" folder.

### Grant Accessibility Permission

[**Why "Input Monitoring" is not enough in Catalina?**](https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/issues/157#issuecomment-669409152)

Follow the instruction when you first open Unshaky. If the instruction does not work for you, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy (Tab) -> Accessibility (Left panel) and add "Unshaky.app." Make sure it is checked.

**Since macOS 10.15.6, also add Unshaky to Privacy (Tab) -> Input Monitoring (Left panel), see [issue #166](https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/issues/166)**

### Launch at Startup (Optional)

### Configure delays for your defective keys

Click Unshaky icon in the menu bar and select "Configure" to configure delays for the defective keys.

#### How to pick an appropriate delay?

I don't think there is a universal delay value for all people. If you type very fast, you might want to have a shorter delay. I use 40 ms since I am a fast typer. With a long delay, I cannot type "apple" because the second "p" is likely to be blocked. Some users found 60 ms a sweet spot and some have no issue with 80 ms. My suggestion is to start with a short delay (like 40 ms) and gradually increase it.
